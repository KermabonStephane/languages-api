# Languages API Constitution
<!-- This constitution outlines the core principles and standards for the Languages API project. -->

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
We are committed to writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. All code must adhere to established coding standards and pass static analysis checks before being merged.

### II. Testing Standards
Rigorous testing is non-negotiable. Every feature must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the reliability and correctness of our API.

### III. User Experience Consistency
A consistent and intuitive user experience is paramount. All API endpoints and data structures must follow a consistent design pattern to ensure they are easy to understand and use.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The API must be fast and scalable. We will define, measure, and adhere to strict performance benchmarks for all critical endpoints to ensure a high-quality experience for our users.

### V. Clean Architecture
We will follow the principles of Clean Architecture to build a system that is decoupled, independently testable, and easy to maintain. This will involve a clear separation of concerns between the different layers of the application.

## Development Workflow

All code changes must be submitted as pull requests and require at least one approval from a core contributor before being merged. All pull requests must pass all automated checks, including linting, testing, and static analysis.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for the project's development standards. Any amendments to this constitution must be proposed as a pull request and be approved by the project's core maintainers.
